# maps-r-us

## Project Description/User Story: 

GIVEN a user wants to go on a trip
GIVEN a user wants to find a activites/places to go in a selected city
WHEN a search for a city is executed on our site
THEN they are presented with different activities/places of interest in that area
THEN they are able to click on which activities interest them and be stored in an intinerary
THEN they are able to choose itineraries that were previously saved to view the information

Our project  allows a user to enter in a city that they want to visit.  We will use an API from HERE maps to give information about that city including places of interest or activities that are close by.  The user will be able to select which activities interest them and then it is stored in a database that can be recalled again later when they want to look at the different itineraries that they have selected.  

## New Technology used
We need to research WHICH npm to use but include a way that the user can have the itinerary emailed to them.

## API's:
   HERE Maps
